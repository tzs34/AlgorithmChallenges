You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a dictionary â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.

**Example**

Input string = 'Dog, cat , dog. Goldfish; dog. I like dogs the most'

Should yeild 
{
    Dog: 3,
    Dogs: 1,
    ....
}
